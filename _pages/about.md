I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/), [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/), and [Duncan Watts](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/duncan-j-watts-phd). I am broadly interested in the intersection of Machine Learning, Game Theory, and broader Computational Social Science questions. Prior to this, I graduated from Stanford University with a B.A.S. in Mathematics and Economics (Honors). During my time there, I was lucky to work with and be advised by [Matthew Jackson](http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/), [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/), and [Alain Schläpfer](https://sites.google.com/site/alainschlaepfer). I also spent a year working in the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ([DSGE](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/dsge#/overview)) Team at the New York Federal Reserve. 

Research/Experience
======
- Oracle-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Max Value Ensembles. Joint work with M. Hussing, M. Kearns, A. Roth, and J. Sorrell. *ICML: ARLET, WIML, NeurIPS: Main 2024.* [Preprint: May 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16739)
- Advised by Matthew Jackson for my Honors Thesis, I studied the role of homophily in the malleability of social networks using techniques drawn from Mean-Field Game Theory [here](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:tc454jm3013/HonorsThesisFinal_SikataSengupta.pdf)
- Worked on online estimation of Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian Models (HANK) using Sequential Monte Carlo at the NY Federal Reserve [here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1071.pdf?sc_lang=en). I also briefly worked on speeding up Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to estimate medium-scale DSGE models.
- Developed an algorithm with Itai Ashlagi that matches students in the San Francisco area with schools based upon a generalized version of the Probabilistic Serial Dictatorship mechanism with distributional constraints
- Collaborating with Alain Schläpfer on Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning for Optimal Stopping Problems [here](https://github.com/psamathe50/SecretaryProblem_ImitationLearning/blob/main/Secretary_Problem_ArXiv_Final%20(1).pdf)
- Civic Digital Fellow in Research & Statistics through Coding it Forward where I worked on Imputation of Revenue for the County Business Patterns dataset for the U.S. Census Bureau
