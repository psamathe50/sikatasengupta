I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/), [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/), and [Duncan Watts](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/duncan-j-watts-phd). I am broadly interested in the intersection of Machine Learning Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory, and Reinforcement Learning/Control (especially their practical and social applications). Prior to this, I graduated from Stanford University with a B.A.S. in Mathematics and Economics (Honors). During my time there, I was lucky to work with and be advised by [Matthew Jackson](http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/), [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/), and [Alain Schläpfer](https://sites.google.com/site/alainschlaepfer). I also spent a year working in the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ([DSGE](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/dsge#/overview)) Team at the New York Federal Reserve. I am currently supported by the [NSF GRFP Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program).

Research/Experience
======
- Amazon Robotics Research Scientist Intern (2025)
- Cooperative AI Summer School (2025)
- Women in Theory (2025)
- Advised by Matthew Jackson for my Honors Thesis, I studied the role of homophily in the malleability of social networks using techniques drawn from Mean-Field Game Theory [here](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:tc454jm3013/HonorsThesisFinal_SikataSengupta.pdf)
- Worked on online estimation of Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian Models (HANK) using Sequential Monte Carlo at the NY Federal Reserve. I also briefly worked on speeding up Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to estimate medium-scale DSGE models.
- Developed an algorithm with Itai Ashlagi that matches students in the San Francisco area with schools based upon a generalized version of the Probabilistic Serial Dictatorship mechanism with distributional constraints
- Collaborating with Alain Schläpfer on Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning for Optimal Stopping Problems [here](https://github.com/psamathe50/SecretaryProblem_ImitationLearning/blob/main/Secretary_Problem_ArXiv_Final%20(1).pdf)
