I am a first-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by Michael Kearns, Aaron Roth, and Duncan Watts. I am broadly interested in the intersection of Machine Learning, Game Theory, and broader Computational Social Science questions. Prior to this, I graduated from Stanford University with a B.A.S. in Mathematics and Economics (Honors). During my time there, I was lucky to work with and be advised by Matthew Jackson, Itai Ashlagi, and Alain Schl√§epfer. I also spent a year working in the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Team at the New York Federal Reserve. You can reach me at sikata@seas.upenn.edu.
